# AI Search Agent

A generic AI search agent, implemented in Java.

The project is a part of the practical assignment(s) for the course of _Artificial Intelligence_ in the GUC.

A maze problem (based on the Avengers movies) is implemented as well according to the [description](https://github.com/mohGhazala96/AI-Search-Alogrithms/blob/master/project-description.pdf).

## Implemented algorithms

### Uninformed algorithms

- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Depth First Search (DFS)
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)

### Informed algorithms (heuristic based)

- Greedy Search
- A-start Search (A\*)
